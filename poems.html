From a distance I see them <br> 
I feel their pain and anguish <br> 
I want to help them <br> 
But my knee is bound to the ground because of sorrows <br> 
Humans <br> 
Up above the cloud <br> 
I wish I could help but my wings are bound <br> 
I want to fly but they are cling together by this wood<br>  
I can't free myself to save them <br> 
All I can do is wonder from a distance <br> 
Humans <br> 
They call on me each day for help <br> 
They shout my name from the mountain top<br> 
I heard them say , where is the Angel that saves? , <br> 
Where is the Angel that deliver? <br> 
Where is the Angel that flaps her wings like that of a mighty eagle? <br> 
Where is the Angel that is as bright as the stars? <br> 
Humans <br> 
Now I am stuck on the clouds <br> 
Waiting for right time to be free <br> 
To be free from this bondage <br> 
To be able to fly once again <br> 
I am broken , but I have one last hope <br> 
Time<br>

Oh God , Oh my God<br> 
Where can I find your humility <br> 
You love keeps me warm <br> 
And your breast gives me comfort<br>  
I lay peacefully in your arms and I am not shaken <br> 
Your soft voice and your calm word keeps my soul at peace <br> 
Where can I find a God so powerful and great<br> 
Where can I find a God that answereth by fire <br> 
Where can I find a God that sees all <br> 
Where can I find a God that holds the cosmic as his own <br> 
Where can I find a God so powerful and  exhorted above all <br> 
You give me sweet sleep in the evening and in the morning your love is renewed towards me, <br> 
I would Like to sing with psalms and praise you in every language I know <br> 
You have earned names of yourself <br> 
Not just any name , but names and attributes that was given because of your mighty works, <br> 
You've given man the abilities of God <br> 
You've made man gods of the land <br> 
You saw all and you said it was good <br> 
YHVH , reign forever <br> 
Reign for ever and ever <br> 
Let the inhabitants of the earth praise the name of the Lord <br> 
The Lord great and mighty , the one who strikes our enemies with fear <br> 
He has always been God of all , the I am that I am <br> 
Power beyond measures , strength beyond measures, <br> 
Love beyond measures , faithfulness beyond measures<br> 
humility beyond measures , mercy beyond measures , supremacy beyond measures, <br> 
Brightness beyond measures , intelligence beyond measures ,<br>  
I am trying to write down the glories I've witness and heard of <br> 
I asked that your spirit will fill my , so that I will be able to write into Depth of who you really are, <br> 
Jehovah Jireh , JEHOVAH-Mâ€™KADDESH, JEHOVAH-ROPHE, <br> Jehovah Shalom , JEHOVAH-NISSI, Adonai , <br> Elshaddai ,Infinite God .<br>

I type with  tears <br> 
Fear is crippling me <br> 
My hands are shaking , <br> 
 auto correct can't get my words right .<br> 
 Just when I thought I have seen it all <br> 
 There I saw , the suffering of men<br> 
 People moving without direction ,<br> 
 Their main motive is to last for the day <br> 
 They have no plan , no vision <br> 
 They just want to survive till the next sunrise.<br> 
 Men , women and children all in pain <br> 
 Solomon said it , now I know <br> 
 Under the sun is suffering <br> 
 Under the sun is pain <br> 
 Under the sun is Hunger <br> 
 And after all the suffering, it is all in vain <br> 
 You will die and leave it all <br> 
 That is absurd I thought <br> 
 Why should you suffer and end up with nothing ?<br> 
 Some claim there is an Invisible God<br> 
 A God that has prepared a perfect Eutopia <br> 
 The Eutopia is prepared for the End <br> 
 The End of all things , Yes the End so they say <br> 
 But wait , when did all this suffering begin ?<br> 
 Where did we come from ?<br> 
 How did we end up here ?<br> 
 On  the third planet closer a star <br> 
 They say the greatest thing is to be born ,<br> 
 I think the greatest crime is to be born just to suffer <br>

  I see the pain that comes with it <br> 
  Skin that has wrinkles and flesh like the bark of a tree .<br> 
  Hair as grey as the ashes <br> 
  Nails as weak as  lead in fire <br> 
  I can count the veins on her  skin<br> 
  And all the capillaries scattered on the surface .<br> 
  The teeth has lost it glory and her smile has lost it comfort <br> 
  The fire in her eye is dying <br> 
  Her body weight is as light as graphene<br> 
  She has lost her friendship with gravity <br> 
  The flesh has given way for the bones to be counted <br> 
  Her ribs are as visible as the moon at night <br> 
  Her joints are weak and her bones have failed , <br> the sound of her bones is like a hymn  to Death <br> 
  There is no hair to sing praises on her skin ,for they have all fallen into  slumber <br> 
  Casting her mind back to 1882 when her innocent body came out of her mother womb <br> 
  Coming back to  2021 as if she just time traveled,<br> 
  There she is lying down on the mat immobile <br> 
  She has live through some part of civilization<br> 
  She has seen kings overthrown, she hasn't live through history , she is history <br> 
  Pain is an old friend that visit her regularly<br> 
  When she lost her first child , her husband , her three daughters , her grandsons and granddaughter <br> 
  Her eyes have no tears to spare <br> 
  Sahara Desert is inferior to the dryness on her lips <br> 
  Now all she is left with is the memories she had , replaying on her eyes until the collector of souls come .<br> 
  Death , the one that ends it all <br>
