    <p class="text">
      <span>From a distance I see them </span>
      <span>I feel their pain and anguish </span>
      <span>I want to help them </span>
      <span>But my knee is bound to the ground because of sorrows </span>
      <span>Humans </span>
      <span>Up above the cloud </span>
      <span>I wish I could help but my wings are bound </span>
      <span>I want to fly but they are cling together by this wood</span>
      <span>I can't free myself to save them </span>
      <span>All I can do is wonder from a distance </span>
      <span>Humans </span>
      <span>They call on me each day for help </span>
      <span>They shout my name from the mountain top</span>
      <span>I heard them say , where is the Angel that saves? , </span>
      <span>Where is the Angel that deliver? </span>
      <span>Where is the Angel that flaps her wings like that of a mighty eagle? </span>
      <span>Where is the Angel that is as bright as the stars? </span>
      <span>Humans </span>
      <span>Now I am stuck on the clouds </span>
      <span>Waiting for right time to be free </span>
      <span>To be free from this bondage </span>
      <span>To be able to fly once again </span>
      <span>I am broken , but I have one last hope </span>
      <span>Time</span>

      <span>Oh God , Oh my God</span>
      <span>Where can I find your humility? </span>
      <span>You love keeps me warm </span>
      <span>And your breast gives me comfort</span>
      <span>I lay peacefully in your arms and I am not shaken </span>
      <span>Your soft voice and your calm word keeps my soul at peace </span>
      <span>Where can I find a God so powerful and great?</span>
      <span>Where can I find a God that answereth by fire ?</span>
      <span>Where can I find a God that sees all? </span>
      <span>Where can I find a God that holds the cosmic as his own? </span>
      <span>Where can I find a God so powerful and exhorted above all? </span>
      <span>You give me sweet sleep in the evening and in the morning your love is renewed towards me, </span>
      <span>I would Like to sing with psalms and praise you in every language I know </span>
      <span>You have earned names of yourself </span>
      <span>Not just any name , but names and attributes that was given because of your mighty works, </span>
      <span>You've given man the abilities of God </span>
      <span>You've made man gods of the land </span>
      <span>You saw all and you said it was good </span>
      <span>YHVH , reign forever </span>
      <span>Reign for ever and ever </span>
      <span>Let the inhabitants of the earth praise the name of the Lord </span>
      <span>The Lord great and mighty , the one who strikes our enemies with fear </span>
      <span>He has always been God of all , the I am that I am </span>
      <span>Power beyond measures , strength beyond measures, </span>
      <span>Love beyond measures , faithfulness beyond measures</span>
      <span>Humility beyond measures , mercy beyond measures , supremacy beyond measures, </span>
      <span>Brightness beyond measures , intelligence beyond measures ,</span>
      <span>I am trying to write down the glories I've witness and heard of </span>
      <span>I asked that your spirit will fill my , so that I will be able to write into Depth of who you really are,
      </span>
      <span>Jehovah Jireh , JEHOVAH-Mâ€™KADDESH, JEHOVAH-ROPHE, </span>

      <h1>Cry for the People</h1>

    <p class="text">
      <span>I type with tears </span>
      <span>Fear is crippling me </span>
      <span>My hands are shaking , </span>
      <span>auto correct can't get my words right .</span>
      <span>Just when I thought I have seen it all </span>
      <span>There I saw , the suffering of men</span>
      <span>People moving without direction ,</span>
      <span>Their main motive is to last for the day </span>
      <span>They have no plan , no vision </span>
      <span>They just want to survive till the next sunrise.</span>
      <span>Men , women and children all in pain </span>
      <span>Solomon said it , now I know </span>
      <span>Under the sun is suffering </span>
      <span>Under the sun is pain </span>
      <span>Under the sun is Hunger </span>
      <span>And after all the suffering, it is all in vain </span>
      <span>You will die and leave it all </span>
      <span>That is absurd I thought </span>
      <span>Why should you suffer and end up with nothing ?</span>
      <span>Some claim there is an Invisible God</span>
      <span>A God that has prepared a perfect Eutopia </span>
      <span>The Eutopia is prepared for the End </span>
      <span>The End of all things , Yes the End so they say </span>
      <span>But wait , when did all this suffering begin ?</span>
      <span>Where did we come from ?</span>
      <span>How did we end up here ?</span>
      <span>On the third planet closer a star </span>
      <span>They say the greatest thing is to be born ,</span>
      <span>I think the greatest crime is to be born just to suffer </span>

      <h1>Old age -Grandma</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      <span>I see the pain that comes with it </span>
      <span>Skin that has wrinkles and flesh like the bark of a tree .</span>
      <span>Hair as grey as the ashes </span>
      <span>Nails as weak as lead in fire </span>
      <span>I can count the veins on her skin</span>
      <span>And all the capillaries scattered on the surface .</span>
      <span>The teeth has lost it glory and her smile has lost it comfort </span>
      <span>The fire in her eye is dying </span>
      <span>Her body weight is as light as graphene</span>
      <span>She has lost her friendship with gravity </span>
      <span>The flesh has given way for the bones to be counted </span>
      <span>Her ribs are as visible as the moon at night </span>
      <span>Her joints are weak and her bones have failed , the sound of her bones is like a hymn to Death </span>
      <span>There is no hair to sing praises on her skin ,for they have all fallen into slumber </span>
      <span>Casting her mind back to 1882 when her innocent body came out of her mother womb </span>
      <span>Coming back to 2021 as if she just time traveled,</span>
      <span>There she is lying down on the mat immobile </span>
      <span>She has live through some part of civilization</span>
      <span>She has seen kings overthrown, she hasn't live through history , she is history </span>
      <span>Pain is an old friend that visit her regularly</span>
      <span>When she lost her first child , her husband , her three daughters , her grandsons and granddaughter </span>
      <span>Her eyes have no tears to spare </span>
      <span>Sahara Desert is inferior to the dryness on her lips </span>
      <span>Now all she is left with is the memories she had , replaying on her eyes until the collector of souls come</span>
      <span>Death , the one that ends it all </span>
